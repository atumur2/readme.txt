Languages: C, C++, Python
Interests: Game Development, Software Engineering

Lifelong interest in computer software and hardware. Always curious about learning new programming languages and the process of developing. Currently working on further my knowledge through personal projects and will publish here. Experience in the use of systems in the various jobs that I have worked in. Current employment in a community pharmacy has given me a personal experience of the use of a healthcare/medical database that is used in an eveyrday setting. This combined with the things that I have learned in my education so far has lead to a passion in creating better systems. 

In the future, I hope to become an active contributer in a team that is working on creating tools and systems to be used by the public and professional as a whole. Interested in working on third party development teams to gain a further understanding on everchanging software programs.
